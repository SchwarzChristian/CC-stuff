some scripts for [Computer Craft](http://www.computercraft.info/).

you should not use any of these because they are very buggy at the moment and the APIs will be changed without taking care of compatibility ;)

install
-------

if you just want to try it, do the following:
* clone the repo
* built a turtle and a computer
* create a file or directory on the turtle and the computer
* run the 'id' command on both machines and remember the ids
* navigate to \<minecraft\>/saves/\<yourSavegameName\>/computer
* copy all files and dirs from \<repo\>/computer to the directory named with the id of your computer
* copy all files and dirs from \<repo\>/turtle to the directory named with the id of your turtle
* reboot both machines ingame
* enjoy your buggy and unfinished but new software ;)
